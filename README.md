### Docker Installation Script 

This script automates the installation of Docker on Linux systems. It checks whether Docker is already installed, and if not, it installs Docker along with its required dependencies.

Installation Steps

    Copy the script into a new .sh file, for example install_docker.sh.
    Give the script execute permissions:

chmod +x install_docker.sh

Run the script:

    ./install_docker.sh
